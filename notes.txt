when this list of books changes in the any way,we need to update content.---->State



push modifies the exisitng array
JS finds the exisitng array and adds an element



but in the react

//References to the new state ----> [{id:99,title:'abc'},{id:123,title:'dfe'}];

//References to the current state -----> [{id:99,title:'abc'}];

React will process the rerender


****** 
Do not mutate/Change/Modify arrays or objects when they are used as state.


//Filter Method always returns a new array.
Filter Keeps True
